\title{How I scrape websites}
\author{Thomas Levine}

\begin{document}

I haven't yet found a guide to web scraping that explained most of
the things that I think should be explained. In particular, I have
a rather structured approach to writing scrapers, and I don't think
this approach is conveyed well in most guides to scraping. Thus, I
create this guide.
